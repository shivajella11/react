# Notification Overlap Fix - CRM Reports Section

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

### **Problem:**
- In the CRM Reports section, when clicking on notifications, the notification panel was being overlapped by the Advanced Customer Analytics banner
- The notification panel was sliding in from the right side but getting hidden behind the banner

### **Root Cause:**
- The notification panel had `z-index: 1000`
- The Advanced Customer Analytics banner had competing z-index values
- The banner was positioned above the notification panel in the stacking context

### **Solution Applied:**

#### **1. Increased Notification Panel Z-Index**
**File:** `milkreact/src/components/Pages/CRM/css/CustomerNotifications.css`
```css
.notifications-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  z-index: 1100; /* Increased from 1000 to 1100 */
  animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease-out;
}
```

#### **2. Removed Banner Z-Index Conflicts**
**File:** `milkreact/src/components/Pages/CRM/css/CustomerReports.css`
- Removed any conflicting z-index values from the banner
- Ensured the banner stays in normal document flow
- Banner now has no z-index, allowing notifications to appear above it

### **Z-Index Hierarchy (Fixed):**
1. **Header Navigation:** `z-index: 1000` (unchanged)
2. **Header Dropdowns:** `z-index: 1050` (profile, language dropdowns)
3. **Notification Panel:** `z-index: 1100` (now highest priority)
4. **Banner:** No z-index (normal document flow)

### **Result:**
- ✅ Notification panel now appears above the Advanced Customer Analytics banner
- ✅ Header elements remain unaffected and work perfectly
- ✅ No visual conflicts or overlapping issues
- ✅ Smooth slide-in animation from right side works correctly
- ✅ All interactive elements remain accessible

### **Testing Scenarios:**
1. **CRM Reports Page:** Click notification icon → Panel slides in from right and is fully visible
2. **Header Dropdowns:** Profile and language dropdowns still work correctly
3. **Banner Interactions:** All banner controls remain functional
4. **Mobile Responsive:** Notification panel adapts to full width on mobile devices

### **Files Modified:**
- `milkreact/src/components/Pages/CRM/css/CustomerNotifications.css` - Increased z-index to 1100
- `milkreact/src/components/Pages/CRM/css/CustomerReports.css` - Removed conflicting z-index values

The notification overlap issue in the CRM Reports section has been completely resolved while maintaining all existing functionality.
